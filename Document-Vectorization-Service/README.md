graph LR
    A[Input Document] --> B[Text Extraction]
    B --> C[Semantic Chunking]
    C --> D[Vector Embedding]
    D --> E[Qdrant Storage]
```

- Extracts text from PDFs, DOCX, TXT, and HTML.
- Uses semantic chunking to split text into meaningful chunks with overlap.
- Embeds text using Google Gemini AI.
- Stores vectors in Qdrant for fast retrieval.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ AI Chatbot Interaction

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Query] --> B[Retrieve Documents]
    B --> C[Vector Search in Qdrant]
    C --> D[Construct AI Prompt]
    D --> E[Google Gemini AI Response]
    E --> F[Chatbot UI]
```

- Accepts customer-specific queries or queries across all document categories.
- Searches stored knowledge for relevant data.
- Uses Google Gemini AI to generate responses.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Real-time Updates

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Document Change] --> B[WebSocket Event]
    B --> C[Client Notification]
    C --> D[UI Update]
```

- Uses WebSockets for real-time communication between server and client.
- Instantly notifies clients when documents are added, updated, or deleted.
- Eliminates the need for polling, improving performance and user experience.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Credentials] --> B[JWT Token Generation]
    B --> C[Token Storage]
    C --> D[Protected Routes/APIs]
    D --> E[Token Validation]
    E --> F[Auto Refresh/Logout]
```

- Secures user sessions with JWT tokens
- Validates credentials against database
- Protects sensitive routes and API endpoints
- Handles token expiration gracefully

## ‚ö° Quick Start Guides

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone & Setup

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/arashghezavati/Document-Vectorization-Service.git
cd Document-Vectorization-Service

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r python-services/requirements.txt
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure API Keys

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```
GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
EMBEDDING_DIMENSION=768

# Qdrant Configuration
QDRANT_URL=your_qdrant_cloud_url
QDRANT_API_KEY=your_qdrant_api_key
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start the AI Chatbot API

Run the FastAPI backend to enable chatbot functionality:

```sh
# Make sure you're in the python-services directory
cd python-services

# Start the API server
python run_server.py
```

- Backend URL: http://localhost:8000
- API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Open the Application UI

- Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
- Register or log in to your account.
- Navigate through the simplified interface:
  - **Dashboard**: Overview of your documents and folders.
  - **Documents**: Create folders and upload documents.
  - **Chat**: Interact with the AI chatbot about your documents.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Working with Documents

- Create folders to organize your documents.
- Upload documents with custom names and assign them to folders.
- All documents will be available in the chat interface regardless of folder.
- Use the document filter in chat to focus on specific documents.
- Experience real-time updates when documents are added or deleted.
